# Templated Project

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview
that explains what the project is.
This description should match descriptions added for package managers
(deb/egg files, package.json, etc.)

## Motivation (optional)

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of
the project. This should explain why the project exists.

## Getting Started

You want to get them using your project as quick as possible, to do that,
provide a few awesome code examples, describe dependencies, the requirements
and explanations of how to get the project and how to get up and running.

## Examples

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able
to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code
example. Make sure the project/api you are showing off is obvious, and that your code
is short and concise.

Screenshots welcome! Add them to a `/docs` folder and link to them.
 
## Running Tests / Development Setup
Describe and show how to run the tests - how to replicate your dev setup for example.

## Using ProjectName / API Reference (optional)

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough
the reference docs can be added to the README. For larger projects you can
create a ```/docs``` directory and add in more specific readme files.
For example see  [here](https://github.com/osrg/gobgp/blob/master/README.md).

## Issues

* Link to specific tickets
* Or describe in a high level what the todo

## Contributors
Let people know how they can dive into the project, include things like
tickets, issue trackers, hipchat channels, Functional/Technical Spec links etc.
